## Problem Statement
* The "Smart Selfie Capture with Smile Detection and Age Prediction" project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automatically captures selfies when a smile is detected and predicts the user&#39;s age in real-time. The system will leverage computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize smiles and estimate age using pre-trained models and datasets. The project involves data collection, model training, and UI integration to create a user-friendly application.
* The outcome of this project will be an intelligent application capable of detecting a user's smile and capturing a selfie automatically while also displaying an estimated age. This will be achieved through a Python-based application using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other deep-learning libraries. The final product will feature a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction. The project will conclude with extensive testing to ensure the model's accuracy, performance, and usability.
